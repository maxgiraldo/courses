**What is alpha?** | • $\alpha_i$ = manager skill beyond market risk
 | • Measures excess return after adjusting for systematic risk
 | • Positive alpha indicates outperformance
**CAPM equation?** | • $r_{i,t} - r_{F,t} = \alpha_i + \beta_i(r_{M,t} - r_{F,t}) + \varepsilon_{i,t}$
 | • $r_i$ = return on asset i, $r_F$ = risk-free rate
 | • $r_M$ = market return, $\beta_i$ = systematic risk
**What is beta?** | • $\beta_i$ = systematic risk measure
 | • $\beta_i = \frac{Cov(r_i, r_M)}{Var(r_M)}$
 | • Beta > 1: more volatile than market
**Risk decomposition?** | • Total risk = Systematic risk + Unsystematic risk
 | • $\sigma_i^2 = \beta_i^2 \sigma_M^2 + \sigma_{\varepsilon_i}^2$
 | • Only systematic risk is compensated in equilibrium

## Portfolio Performance Evaluation

**Sharpe Ratio?** | • $SR = \frac{r_p - r_f}{\sigma_p}$
 | • Measures excess return per unit of total risk
 | • Higher ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance
**Treynor Ratio?** | • $TR = \frac{r_p - r_f}{\beta_p}$
 | • Measures excess return per unit of systematic risk
 | • Useful for well-diversified portfolios
**Information Ratio?** | • $IR = \frac{\alpha_p}{\sigma(\varepsilon_p)}$
 | • Measures active return per unit of active risk
 | • Alpha divided by tracking error
**Jensen's Alpha?** | • $\alpha_J = r_p - [r_f + \beta_p(r_m - r_f)]$
 | • CAPM-based performance measure
 | • Positive alpha indicates outperformance

## Market Efficiency & Anomalies

### Cue Column | Notes Section
---|---
**EMH Forms?** | • **Weak**: Prices reflect historical information
 | • **Semi-strong**: Prices reflect all public information
 | • **Strong**: Prices reflect all information (public + private)
**Size Effect?** | • Small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap
 | • $r_{small} - r_{large} > 0$ historically
 | • May be risk premium for illiquidity
**Value Premium?** | • High book-to-market stocks outperform growth stocks
 | • $r_{HML} = r_{high B/M} - r_{low B/M} > 0$
 | • Captured in Fama-French 3-factor model
**Momentum Effect?** | • Past winners tend to continue winning (3-12 months)
 | • $r_{WML} = r_{winners} - r_{losers} > 0$
 | • Reverses over longer horizons (3-5 years)

## Summary

The CAPM framework provides a foundation for understanding risk-return relationships in financial markets. Alpha ($\alpha$) represents manager skill, while beta ($\beta$) captures systematic risk exposure. Performance evaluation metrics like Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, and Information ratio help assess risk-adjusted returns. Market anomalies such as size effect, value premium, and momentum challenge the strong form of market efficiency and suggest opportunities for active management strategies.
